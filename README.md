# jQuery SelectorSet patch

Speeds up jQuery event delegation by using [SelectorSet](https://github.com/josh/selector-set) for matching event targets.


## Installation

Available on [Bower](http://bower.io) as **jquery-selector-set**.

```
$ bower install jquery-selector-set
```

This should also download the dependencies, [**jquery**](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) and [**selector-set**](https://github.com/josh/selector-set).

Alternatively you can download the `jquery.selector-set.js` and `selector-set.js` files individually. I'll assume you probably already have jQuery itself setup at this point.

```
$ curl -O https://raw.github.com/josh/jquery-selector-set/master/jquery.selector-set.js
$ curl -O https://raw.github.com/josh/selector-set/master/selector-set.js
```
